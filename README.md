🌟 MBTI Pep Talk App 🌟

Welcome to the MBTI Pep Talk App, a fun and interactive web app that delivers personalized pep talks based on MBTI types and user-selected moods. This app combines the power of a serverless API and a sleek, chic user interface.

🚀 About the Project

The MBTI Pep Talk App allows users to select their MBTI type and mood to receive a personalized pep talk. The moods supported are default, sad, and angry. This app calls the custom-built MBTI Pep Talk API to fetch messages crafted just for your personality type and mood.

This project was created to demonstrate my skills as a Technical Writer and showcase my understanding of APIs. By building both the API and the app, I aimed to illustrate how technical documentation, development, and design can come together to create an engaging and functional user experience.

This app is a creative way to mix motivation with personality psychology, and it’s only going to get better with more moods, advice, and customization in the future!

📚 How It Works

User Input: Users select their MBTI type (like INTJ, ENFP, etc.) and mood (default, sad, or angry) from a simple, stylish dropdown.

API Call: The app sends a request to the MBTI Pep Talk API.

Response: The app displays a pep talk customized to the selected MBTI and mood.

🛠️ Features

Interactive Dropdowns: Choose your MBTI type and mood for a customized experience.

Personalized Pep Talks: Get motivating advice tailored to you.

Jiwon Aesthetic: Sleek, pastel colors and a baddie-inspired design.

Responsive Design: Works beautifully on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
